# Cedar Grove Indoor Air Quality Monitor

### _A portable PyBadge indoor CO2 montor_

## Overview

The Indoor Air Quality Monitor is a portable SCD-30-based ambient CO2 measurement device implemented using CircuitPython implemented on an Adafruit PyBadge (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200) handheld gaming platform. Features include graphical and numeric display of measured CO2, qualitative descriptor, and user-configurable alarm setting. The PyBadge platform provides the color display, speaker for the audible alarm (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4227), and room for a LiPo rechargeable battery (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4237).

This implementation uses the Adafruit Adafruit SCD-30 - NDIR CO2 Temperature and Humidity Sensor breakout (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4867).

The Indoor Air Quality Monitor utilizes a number of PyBadge-stored files and conversion helpers in order to operate. The bundle folder contains all the files and helpers needed for CircuitPython version 6.x.
